Make Sure You Have Python Installed.

Just copy the code or download the code, and paste it in a textfile with .py Extension.

You can also use other python editor like Jupyter Notebook or Pycharm, but the complete Advantage of the code will be obtained, only if you run it from command prompt or if you directly double the .py file.
 
You can also use idle to paste code, but make sure you run the code either using CMD or Double tapping the .py file only.

Any Doubts ask in the Comment Section.
